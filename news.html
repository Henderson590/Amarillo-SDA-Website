                                Starting September 28th 12pm-2pm, there will be multiple Women's Ministry Events. Starting with Cards Kahoots, we will be putting together cards for members to let them know that we are thinking about them and we want to let them know we are here for them.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Women's Ministry GroupMe</h3>

                                For those of you who are having issues with the GroupMe, you need to download the moblie app in order to join the GroupMe. It will be the primary way of communicating with eachother to know what events are happening when, to encourage eachother, pray for eachother and other church members.

                                We are going to develop a Women's Ministry Visitor team, this will allow the greetings to come beyond the doors and make it into the sanctuary. We have things planned, but they are still in development. We hope to have something solid by next month. We have good things coming, and we are excited! We hope you support us!
